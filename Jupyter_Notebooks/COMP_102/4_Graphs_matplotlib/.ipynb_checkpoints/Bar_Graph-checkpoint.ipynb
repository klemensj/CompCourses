    "Hello, welcome to one of the first graphing exercieses for this class. We will be using the Matplotlib package (that's already installed in your Anaconda/Spyder IDE) to produce a bar graph. **While it may be easier, faster, and prettier to use Excel to make two or three bar graphs for your lab report that's due in a couple of days, it can be time-consuming when this process is repeated hundreds, if not, thousands of time when you are processing large armounts of raw data.** As we know, experiments in science must be repeated, sometimes hundreds of times. It would **not** be wise to hire a intern for the sole purpose of making hundreds of bar graphs or pie charts.\n",

There are many people out there using Python...we are scientists, so we will be dealing with the statistical side of Python...so we must import these statistical/scientific packages.\n",

    "What does this mean? With `import pandas`, we are telling python to import a library called `pandas`. Usually, whenever we need to refer to/use the pandas library, we write something like.... `pandas.read_csv` or `pandas.array` or `pandas.do_this`. You see the basic set-up of using something from the pandas library (or any library!) -> `name_of_library.name_of_action` . Another way to think about this is that you are accessing an action within a folder called \"pandas\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "Having said this, notice that the word \"pandas\" has 6 characters. It's not particularlly long compared to other library names, but time adds up, and typing this 6 character library name thousands of times can decrease our effiency in writing code.

    "This story can be applied to the latter half of the 1st line of code. With `as pd`, we are telling python that we want to replace the word `pandas` with `pd` (while we are writing code in Spyder!). Notice we are not replacing or renaming the pandas library to `pd`, just simply telling the computer that we would like to write the simplified `pd` instead of `pandas` every time."
