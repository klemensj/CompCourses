    "# Working with python libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "A **library** in python is a collection of pre-written code that many different programmers may find useful. Libraries allow you to apply complex solutions without having to code them 'from scratch'. Libraries contain pre-written **functions** for performing certain tasks, **class definitions** that create objects with particular characteristics,  **methods** for manipulating those classes and thus allowing the user to do very specific things, and even global **variable** definitions. **Library** is an umbrella term that includes everything from a file of your own code that contains a few frequently-used functions to external python **packages** that are available for download. Some of these external packages have become so popular that many if not most python programmers employ them. In practice, the terms library and package are often used interchangably. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another level of consideration are **modules**, which are the building blocks of libraries and packages. They likewise can contain functions, classes, methods, and variables. Take a look at the article <a href='https://learnpython.com/blog/python-modules-packages-libraries-frameworks/'>Difference Between Python Modules, Packages, Libraries, and Frameworks</a> to understand the difference and the overlap between these terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use a library in python, that library, or some component of it, must be imported into your program using some application of the `import` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-in modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in functions and methods are the ones we have used so far to do most of our programming. These are functions like `print()`, `len()`, `min()`,  `max()`,  and `type()` or common string and list methods like `.append()`, `.upper()`, and `.replace()`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of common libraries that are installed whenever python is installed but that are not used nearly as frequently. These are the built-in modules of python. These include \n",
    "```\n",
    "    os           # tools for working with the operating system\n",
    "    math         # mathematical tools beyond +,-,*,/\n",
    "    random       # tools for working with randomness\n",
    "    statistics   # compute statistical parameters\n",
    "                 ## or perform basic analyses\n",
    "```    \n",
    "To see a full set of built-in types, functions, and libraries, you can view the <a href = 'https://docs.python.org/3/library/'>Python Standard Library</a> as part of python documentation. Note that this overarching collection of things is itself referred to as a library! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing a module\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting access to a built-in module requires us to import the module to our program. This is very straightforward. We simply use the python statement **import** and all of the material within the module becomes available to us. To use the elements of the module, we preced the call to the function or variable with the module name followed by a `.` then the function name, like so: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import module_name  # we usually include this line \n",
    "                    ## at or near the top of our script\n",
    "\n",
    "# some more code follows, defining the variable and whatnot\n",
    "\n",
    "my_answer = module_name.module_function(variable)\n",
    "print(myanswer)\n",
    "```\n",
