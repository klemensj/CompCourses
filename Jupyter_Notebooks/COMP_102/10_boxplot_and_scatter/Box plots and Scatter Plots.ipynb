    "# Box Plots and Scatter Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the graphs that we will look at today share the characteristics of showing the distribution of values very well. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Box Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Box plots are very useful for certain kinds of data. Sometimes you are doing a comparison between groups but you also care a lot about the distribution of values within that group. Box plots do a great job of summarizing more information than a bar, of course, they are also a little bit more complicated to intrepret. This <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=635ErzR9Xzc'>video on box plots </a>(sometimes called box-and-whisker plots) provides a quick introduction. The data in the video, on forest trees, is a nice example. It's easy to imagine that the mean might not be a great descriptor of the \"typical\" age of a forest tree. In any patch of forest, we will have lots of really young individuals, and a few individuals that are much much older than average. So a more descriptive representation is useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the basic intrepretation is that the whiskers represent the range of the data, and the boxes represent what is known as the inter-quartile distance or interquartile range. Quartiles aren't really that complicated. If you think about lining all the data in order, the first quartile are the first 25% of points in your data set. The second quartile is the second 25%, and so on. So the middle two quartiles represent the middle 50% of the data. In a normal distribution, the values of mean and median should be very similar, and data should be evenly distributed around that central value. So we would see symmetrical box and whiskers. Deviations from normality would appear as an asymmetrical distribution of the box and whiskers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other use of boxplots is for evaluating outliers, or 'fliers' in the terminology of matplotlib. Before we said that the whiskers represent the range of the data, but this isn't *quite* true. They represent the range of data that fall within 1.5 times the interquartile distance of the median. Data beyond this range are considered outliers in the context of the dataset, and are represented by individual points. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are other options that can be employed in a boxplot as well. A common one is to 'notch' the boxplot to show the 95% confidence interval around the median. \n",
    "\n",
    "Much like with the histogram function `plt.boxplot` calculates values based on an array of data that is given as the first argument to the boxplot command, `x`. The <a href = 'https://matplotlib.org/3.3.2/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot.html'>function definition for boxplot</a> is a bit more complicated than what we have seen before, so we'll do a couple of examples. In the example below we make a simple array of some skewed data where the median is obviously 5, but the values above 5 are farther from the median than the values below five."
