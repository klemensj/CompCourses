    "# Chi-square analysis and other tests of categorical data\n",

    "Sometimes data naturally falls into discrete categories. In medicine, a subject may have a particular diagnosis or not. The subject of a procedure may be dead, or alive. In evolutionary biology or genetics a subject may possess a particular trait, or not possess it. In behavior a subject may mate successfully, or not. In engineering a structure might fail or not fail. All of these things represent natural categories. It is a reasonable statistical question to ask - what is the likelihood of observing a particular pattern of distribution across categories. Furthermore, can we attach a probability - in the form of a p-value - to our observation. \n",

    "Let's take the example of flipping a coin. We know that the probability of getting either heads or tails is 0.5. We flip a coin 1000 times and get 530 heads. Seems pretty far away from what we expected? But can we test that?\n",

We organize things into a contingency table to see if one variable is <i>contingent</i>, or in other words <i>depends on</i> the other. In this case we see that the occurrence of color-blindness depends on sex of the subject, which we all knew already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with the means comparisons, in our one-way chi-square we started with an example where we new the true value (in this case the 0.5 probability of flipping heads). Usually for real-world questions, however, we don't know what the population level probability is at the outset of the analysis. Take a look at the table below which shows the results of a contingency table of data showing survival rates for two different medical treatments. \n",

    "We can actually  calculate a Chi-square value using the same equation as above. So how do we get our expected values? \n",

    "Just like in a punnett square, these values should sum to one, as they represent the entire set of possibilities. Then if we multiply those values by the total number of observations, we get a table of expected values.
