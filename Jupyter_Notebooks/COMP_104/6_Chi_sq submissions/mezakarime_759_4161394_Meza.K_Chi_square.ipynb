    "Sometimes data naturally falls into discrete categories. In medicine, a subject may have a particular diagnosis or not. The subject of a procedure may be dead, or alive. In evolutionary biology or genetics a subject may possess a particular trait, or not possess it. In behavior a subject may mate successfully, or not. In engineering a structure might fail or not fail. All of these things represent natural categories. It is a reasonable statistical question to ask - what is the likelihood of observing a particular pattern of distribution across categories. Furthermore, can we attach a probability - in the form of a p-value - to our observation. \n",

    "Let's take the example of flipping a coin. We know that the probability of getting either heads or tails is 0.5. We flip a coin 1000 times and get 530 heads. Seems pretty far away from what we expected? But can we test that?\n",

    "|Male| 687 |77|\n",
    "|Female|723|8|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we have the distribution of trichromat and dichromat (color-blind) individuals in a population, as well as the distribution of males and females in the population. We organize things into a contingency table to see if one variable is <i>contingent</i>, or in other words <i>depends on</i> the other. In this case we see that the occurrence of color-blindness depends on sex of the subject, which we all knew already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with the means comparisons, in our one-way chi-square we started with an example where we new the true value (in this case the 0.5 probability of flipping heads). Usually for real-world questions, however, we don't know what the population level probability is at the outset of the analysis. Take a look at the table below which shows the results of a contingency table of data showing survival rates for two different medical treatments. \n",

    "* The survival rates are low!\n",
    "* Of the individuals in our study, many more received treatment B than treatment A \n",
    "* The survival rate for treatment B is slightly lower than for the less common treatment B\n",
    "A Chi-squared test will allow us to answer the following question: Is it likely that the differences between the groups are just the result of sampling, or does it appear that survival is contingent upon the treatment received?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can actually  calculate a Chi-square value using the same equation as above. So how do we get our expected values? \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we can do is this: Calculate the overall frequencies, using the whole data set, for each of the two categorical variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probability  Survived = (16+43) / 1204 = 0.049, Probability Deceased = 0.951\n",
    "Probability  A = (16 + 283) / 1204 = 0.248, Probability B = 0.752\n",

    "|Treatment B(0.752)|0.037|0.715|\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in a punnett square, these values should sum to one, as they represent the entire set of possibilities. Then if we multiply those values by the total number of observations, we get a table of expected values. This table represents our null hypothesis that the two categories are not contingent on one another. \n",

    "|Treatment B_exp|44.5|860.9|\n",
    "\n",
    "These values can now be used in our original equation, such that each cell in our original data is the O<sub>i</sub>  value and each cell in the table of expected values is the E<sub>i</sub> value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Chi-square contingency test the degrees of freedom are calculated similarly to the one-way, except that we multiply the 'rows and columns' of data (r-1) * (c-1) where r and c are the number of categories in each variable. In this case, we still have df = 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Running a chi-square contingency analysis is slightly more complicated than running the one-way test, in that we have to hand the data off to the function as an array. "
