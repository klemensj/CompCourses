We can get information about what the rest of dataset looks like by using the `DataFrame.shape` and `DataFrame.size` methods.

But it turns out that the `read_csv()` function itself can be adjusted to refine our results. There are many adjustments we can make to read_csv. Take a look at the <a href = 'https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html'>official definition of the function </a> in order to get a sense for how many things we can do. None of these values have to be specified, but all of them can be specified. We will try to use `index_col`. Try using the read_csv file to reimport `BigGradebook.csv`, except this time place a comma after the file location, and set `Student` to be the index column. "

    "Finally, let's take a moment to examine how easy it is to output data from a pandas dataframe. We may want to do this to save data once we have manipulated it or modified it with pandas. This can seem a little more intimidating since we are asking to write from the program back to the computer it is housed on. Luckily, there is a pandas method called `DataFrame.to_csv()` that will do what we want. We need to feed this method a file name and a file location, for now we won't worry about any of the other parameters as the defaults will do what we want. If we don't specify a location, and just give a file name, python will write the file to the active directory (the directory where this .ipynb file resides). Use the file name `Exported_BigGradebook.csv`."
