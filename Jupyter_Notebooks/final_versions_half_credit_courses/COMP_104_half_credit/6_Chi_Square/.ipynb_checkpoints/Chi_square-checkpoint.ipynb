    "Sometimes data naturally falls into discrete categories. In medicine, a subject may have a particular diagnosis or not. The subject of a procedure may be dead, or alive. In evolutionary biology or genetics a subject may possess a particular trait, or not possess it. In behavior a subject may mate successfully, or not. In engineering a structure might fail or not fail. All of these things represent natural categories. It is a reasonable statistical question to ask - what is the likelihood of observing a particular pattern of distribution across categories. Furthermore, can we attach a probability - in the form of a p-value - to our observation. \n",
