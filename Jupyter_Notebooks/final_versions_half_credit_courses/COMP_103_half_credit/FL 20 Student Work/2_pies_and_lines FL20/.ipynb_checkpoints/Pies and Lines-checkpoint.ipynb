    "Pie plots have some inherent limitations 9as we can see in our readings for this week). Pie plots have a very specific use: visualizing the relative contributions of various parts to a whole. They are not efficient at conveying fine differences among those components, or for making anything other than high-level comparisons between distributions. That being said, sometimes high-level comparisons are very useful, particularly in informal settings. Presenting a breakdown of spending by a club, department, or organization to the members is a good example use case. \n",

    "The function within pyplot to make a pie chart is `pie`, of course. Take a minute to look at <a href = 'https://matplotlib.org/3.3.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.pie.html'>the definition of the pie function</a>. \n",

    "Below we will make two pie plots. In the first, I will specify some values of x that add up to 1."

    "## Titles and Colors\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things we can explore with a pie chart are introducing titles and modifying the color scheme. The way that pyplot works is that if we don't have to define all parts of a plot at once. If we define a chart, and then run additional pyplot functions they will be applied to the active chart. In the context of an ipython notebook all of the code for a particular plot has to appear within the same code cell. Adding a title is very easy, but very important for communication:\n",
    "```\n",
    "plt.title('The title of the plot')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To change colors within a plot there are a couple of different options. Color is added as a parameter within the   `pie` function. Python has a sequence of colors that it will run through automatically when coloring a plot, so if you leave this blank a predictable set of colors will be added. Otherwise, colors can be assigned individually to match particular data items. This requires passing pyplot another array-like object, like we did for the x value above. Python recognizes a wide range of color names, as shown in the example below. Another option is to find hex codes for the colors you want (from within photoshop, or at a <a href = 'https://www.color-hex.com/color-palettes/'> free color palette site</a>)."

Pick a wedge of the pie and remove it from the rest of the pie to compare it to the others. Use each of `explode`, `labels`, `colors` and `autopct` in making your graph.

    "Labeling of line plots can be undertaken at multiple levels. The quick and dirty version is with an `fmt` (format) string, which allows you to specify shape of the marker, the color of the line and marker, and the line style with a single command. A guide to the allowable values can be found at the <a href = 'https://matplotlib.org/3.3.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html'>defintion of the plot function</a>. However each of these parameters can be specified individually, along with many other options. The approaches can also be combined. In the examples below, which you should examine one at a time by removing the # symbol to make the other lines active, you should see that the first two examples are identical, where in the third the pattern created by the `fmt` sequence is modified by the subsequent parameters. Play around with the line graph parameters to create different shapes of the line below."
