    "\n",
    "Histograms are charts used in descriptive statistics to show the **distribution** of a single variable. The bars represent ranges of the data and the heights of the bars represent the number or count of observations that fall within that range. A histogram shows how observations are distributed. The familiar **bell curve** is usually given as a histogram or a density plot (which is just a 'smoothed' version of a histogram).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Bar plots are used to illustrate a comparison between groups or categories. Typically the bars represent the **mean** value of some variable as measured in different groups. The distribution of values is not shown by a bar plot, to make up for this we can add **error bars** to a bar plot in order to give some idea of how the data varies around the mean that is displayed.\n",

    "Histograms are going to be relatively straighforward to construct. As our graphing needs get more precise, and as we want to include more information in our figures, we may want to have more control over graphs,  in particular finer control over the size of a figure, of the layouts of graphs relative to one another, and over the axes and bounding boxes. Matplotlib can easily control all of these things, but we will need to use a slightly different setup. Before, we simply created an object by calling the matplotlib function directly, for example:\n"

    "Because we are working with a figure item (which we have called `fig`) it's remarkably easy to export a graph once we have created it. The graphs we see within the jupyter notebook are just .png file renderings of the graphs we have created. They don't look very nice. But if we specify a format we can export our figures in many different image formats. Even better, we don't have to use a special command for this. All we have to do to export a figure is use the command: \n",

In vector formats, such as .ps, .eps, or .pdf, images and text can be scaled up without losing resolution, and fonts and text can be subsequently manipulated using a tool such as Adobe Illustrator. However sometimes an image file is simpler to deal with or useful for the application you are looking for. So my default is to export to .pdf, but you should experiment. Image files that are too small, or in compressed formats such as .jpg, can show serious degradation to text and graph elements.\n",
