    "Note how using some natural language made this program easier to understand. We didn't have to designate the items within the list gradebook as `student`, we could have just left it as `i`. But I think it's a lot easier to understand as written. I didn't use 'grade' in the second loop because the list consisted of more than just grades, and I thought I will use `ii` to designate each item to remind myself that this represents the items being examined in the **nested** loop, which just means what it sounds like - a loop contained entirely within another loop. Complex programs can have multiple layers of loops nested within one another. \n",

    "The first \"for\" has \"student\" which is equal to the \"i\" - the reason for having a second \"for\" loop represented by \"ii\" is because this is a nested loop. We need a loop within a loop in order to to print out the \"student id\" and \"minimum score\" as we did in the example.\n",

    "Use an if-then statement embedded within a loop to generate a new string called `my_comp_dna` that contains the complementary strand of DNA to myDNA. A-T and G-C are complementary pairs, so every time an 'A' appears in `my_dna` a 'T' should appear in `my_comp_dna`, and every time a 'T' appears in `my_dna` an 'A' should appear in `my_comp_dna`.  Print both strings side by side so that the answer can easily be checked. \n"
