    "# Lists and List methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are very important data type in python. Lists hold a sequence of data - so understanding lists lets us edge closer to what we often use computers for when programming in the sciences - performing the same operations over and over again on a number of pieces of data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## List Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists as variables are defined similarly to how we define strings, with the main difference being that square brackets `[]` are used instead of quotes `''` or `\"\"` to contain the data. A few major defining characteristics of lists is that: \n",
    "* lists are a data type that can hold different data types, including integers, floats, strings, or other lists\n",
    "* like strings, lists are an interable data type with an index that starts at 0\n",
    "* there are many useful functions and methods that can be performed on a list, including appending new items to the list and changing the values held by the list \n",
    "* values held within a list can be easily changed of updated in the course of running a program, so they can easily hold calculations performed by a program \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code example below, we show the formulation of a list holding a patients sex, age, height in inches, weight, and smoking status. Then we change a value in the list using the index. At the end we print out value and the variable type as we have done for other types. Everything in the code below should make sense before you proceed."

Let's write a piece of code that will take our patient data, calculate BMI, and insert it into the list as an item that follows weight.
