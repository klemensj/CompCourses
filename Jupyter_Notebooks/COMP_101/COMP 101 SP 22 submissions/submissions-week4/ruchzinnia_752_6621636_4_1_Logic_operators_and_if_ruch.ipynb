    "\n",
    "In this week's notebook we will be diving deeper into logical statements in python. Logical statements are  important because they form the basis of what can collectively be referred to as **control flow** within a program. So far the programs we have written are restricted to doing just one thing, in a particular linear order. Let's look at an example of what this means: \n",
    "\n",
    "## Control flow - an example\n",
    "Let's say we are writing a program that handles a nucleotide sequence and like last week we want to know the percentage of A and T residues in the sequence. And let's say additionally that we don't know if the sequence we are getting is RNA or DNA, so there may or may not be Us in place of Ts in the sequence. I'm going to write out in pseudocode the flow the program as we would currently be able to write it. \n",

    "count all As and Ts, divide this value by len(sequence) and print the result\n",

    "Without control flow a computer program is just a glorified calculator with some fancy functions. It can get you from point A to point B along a particular, pre-specified pathway. Control flow can be used to make programs dynamic, or responsive, in numerous ways.This comes up in a lot of different situations. So if you want a program to:\n",

    "\n",
    "To be able to start controlling our programs in this way we need to use some new tools within python, which we can collectively refer to as **logical operators**. The logical operators we will be working with today fall into two categories **comparison operators** and **boolean operators**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### comparison operators\n",
    "There are three main sets of comparison operators: `==` and `!=`; `<` and `>` `<=` and `>=` . Their usage is very similar to what we saw previously with the mathematical operators. The first pair probably requires the most explanation - double-equals `==` is for *comparison* of two variables, whereas we saw previously that a single equal sign `=` is for *assiging* a value to a variable. Likewise `!=` is the *not equal* operator. The rest are simply greater than and less than, or greater than or equal to and less than or equal to just as you would probably expect from the way the operators are written.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are boolean, meaning they return a value a value of `True` or `False`. This makes sense as the result of any comparison between values can be evaluated as being either a true or false statement. Just in case that's not intuitive, let's look at some example code. \n",
