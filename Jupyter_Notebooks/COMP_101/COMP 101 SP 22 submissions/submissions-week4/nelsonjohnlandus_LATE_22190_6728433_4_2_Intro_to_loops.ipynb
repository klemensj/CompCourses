    "A **loop** in a piece of code is a major component of *control flow*. Essentially, a loop is an instruction that repeats until a specified condition is reached. In a loop structure, the loop asks a question. If the answer to that question is `True`, the action specified by the loop is executed. The same question is asked again and again until no further action is required. Each time the question is asked is called an iteration. \n",

    "## The while loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop in Python tells the computer to do something as long as a given condition is met. It’s construct consists of a condition (a logical statement) and a code block. It is very similar in structure to an if-then statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between `while` and the `:`, there is a logical statement that first is `True` but will later become `False` based on the actions that are executed by the code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition is evaluated, and *while* the condition is true, the code within the block is executed. As part of that execution, the condition is updated or adjusted. \n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the statement is True , the rest of the code block will run.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pseudocode it looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "while some condition is True:\n",
    "    do this\n",
