    "For the exercises that follow we will work by completing the function. You learned about functions in part 3 of the solo learn tutorial. Only manipulate the section of code that is commented out. Once your function will run without syntax errors, run the testing block that follows it to test that the function does what it is supposed to do. Note that if the answer is asking for a text string, your function does not need to `print` the text string (although you might want to do that while you are testing the function). Rather it needs to `return` the text string as the result of the function. "
