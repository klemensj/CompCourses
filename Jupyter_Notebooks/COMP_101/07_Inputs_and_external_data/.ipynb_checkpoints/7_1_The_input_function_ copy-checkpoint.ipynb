    "So far all of the programs we have written have been worse than doing the equivalent operation with a calculator, a spreadsheet, or some other tool that doesn't require a programming language. This is because we have had no way to 1) work with data that we didn't type out ourselves in the code of the program (data that is typed in by the user, or stored in an external data file OR 2) give the program instructions once it is running (pressing a button, or typing out numbers, letters, \"yes\" or \"no\"). To get started with this process, we will first take a look at the with the built-in python function `input()`. \n",

    "`input()` is an example of a **function** in python. You have seen this term before but is hasn't been explained yet. Functions take particular **arguments**, which means additional instructinos for how the command is to operate. Arguments The important argument for the input command is a 'prompt' that appears to the user and, just like a prompt in a survey or an exam, solicits the information the program is seeking. Arguments to a function are always given within the parentheses that follow the function name, like this is pseudocode:\n",
    "```\n",
    "some_python_function(argument1, argument2, argument3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of the arguments depends on the function. Arguments can be strings, numbers, lists, etc. depending on what the function is trying to do. Using a function correctly means understanding what arguments it requires. Functions can have any number of arguments. Some arguments are required for the function to work properly, while others are optional. Some arguments must be of a certain data type, while others can accept multiple data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of `input()`, the only argument that it takes is the prompt that the user receives: \n",
    "```\n",
    "input('prompt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So in that sense it's a very simple function. Explore the prompt argument below by commenting and uncommenting the lines at the top of the code block. \n"
