    "This function takes the argument 'file'. This argument is in the form of a file name and directory address of a file that is located on your computer. What do we mean by a directory address?

However, we don't have to just use this directory. We can specify a new folder that is relative to our original location by starting our address by writing `./file.txt` or `./subfolder/file.txt`. In this case the `./` represents the current working directory. So we can access a file in the same directory, or a file within the same subfolder respectively. \n",
