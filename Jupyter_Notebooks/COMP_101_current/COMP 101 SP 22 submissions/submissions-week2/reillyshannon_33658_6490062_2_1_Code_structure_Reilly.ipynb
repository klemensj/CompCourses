    "## Whitespace\n",
    "Another aspect of python code that is important is whitespace. Sometimes, individual lines of code need to be organized into code blocks. A code block is determined by a set of lines that are identically indented. The standard identation in python is 4 presses of the space bar. Once you have established an indent, many text editors and jupyter notebooks will automatically indent the next line for you. Run the next code block, which contains a structure known as a `for` loop. Don't worry about how that works, we will come back to it in much greater detail, the important point is that two print commands that are being looped need to be part of the same code block. "
