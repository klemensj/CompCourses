    "You will recall that **data structures** are the way that we store information within a computer program. They will be used whenever we need to input data, retrieve data from a source, or store information that we generate within a program. We already spent some time with some of the main python data structures, **strings** and **lists**. In this lesson we will work with some data structures that are similar but that have very different properties and methods of manipulations, including the **tuple** and the **dictionary**. \n",

They are very easy to assign, you simply include the items you want in the tuple within parentheses `()`, and separate items with commas. In the example below, our tuple will contain descriptive data (sex, age, height, weight, etc.) for a patient included in a clinical trial."
