    "Use an if-then statement embedded within a loop to generate a new string called `my_comp_dna` that contains the complementary strand of DNA to myDNA. A-T and G-C are complementary pairs, so every time an 'A' appears in `my_dna` a 'T' should appear in `my_comp_dna`, and every time a 'T' appears in `my_dna` an 'A' should appear in `my_comp_dna`.  Print both strings side by side so that the answer can easily be checked. \n"
