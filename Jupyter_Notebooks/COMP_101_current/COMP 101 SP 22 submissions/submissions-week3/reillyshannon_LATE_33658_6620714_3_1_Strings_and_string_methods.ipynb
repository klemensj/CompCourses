This is a complicated idea, but it basically means that any data that exists within a python program has to exist as not only raw data but also must exist within a set of rules that describe what can and can't be done with that data. This grouping of specific data plus rules is known as an **object**. Variables are examples of objects, and our different data types could more formally be described as different **classes** of objects, where the class determines the rules for an object of that type. The `type()` function returns to us the class to which a particular object belongs. \n",

Just above we tried to multiply two string variables (or: objects of class string), and this generated an error. This was the programming language telling us 'Multiplying two objects of class string is not meaningful within the overarching rules of python.'\n",
    "\n",
    "But just as these rules specify what we *can't* do with a particular object, object-oriented programming opens up a whole world for the language developers to describe and develop classes in such a way that they provide highly convenient, built-in ways of manipulating an object of a particular class.
