    "# Programming with Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "An important way to organize code and to make it reusable is to organize it into structures known as **functions**. Most modern programming languages are *functional* languages, meaning that they allow the programmer to write their own code as functions. Functions are independent blocks of code that can be called from anywhere within a program. Functions are also a powerful way to implement **control flow** within a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about functions does require a slightly different approach. We will start with using functions and then move on to defining our own functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The logic of functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used several functions already. `print()`, `input()`, and `len()` are all examples of what are known as **built-in functions** in python. (You can see a complete list of python's built-in functions <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html'>here</a>.) \n",

If the function does not need to return a value to the main body of code, this space can be left empty, set to `return None`, or simply left off the end of the function.
