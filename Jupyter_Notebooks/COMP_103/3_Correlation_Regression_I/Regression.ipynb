Don't worry about what the p value means for now, we will get to that. The data is stored as a <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp'>tuple</a>, in which a single variable name is used to store multiple pieces of data. As you can see at 'Next' page at the link, 'Access Tuples', tuples can be indexed just like a list.
