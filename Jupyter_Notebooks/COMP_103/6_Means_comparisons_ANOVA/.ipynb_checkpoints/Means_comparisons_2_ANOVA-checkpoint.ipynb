    "# Comparing means with ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "The next means comparison strategy we will investigate is the ANOVA, or ANalysis Of VAriance. This is a means comparison strategy that is often used in the life sciences. The name can be a bit confusing, as this test detects differences among means by calculating the ratios between different variance components - specifically the ratio of the variance between samples (which corresponds to the variance among species, experimental treatments, localities, or whatever else we may be comparing) to the variance within samples (the error or residual variance, variability in the data that cannot be attributed to our experimental factors).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to how the the t-test assigned statistical significance by calculating a t-statistic that is then compared to a table of t-values, the ANOVA assigns statistical significance by calculating an **F-statistic** that is compared to a table of F-values. Most simply this can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "F = <u>between sample variance</u>   \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within sample variance\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will compare three different types of ANOVA:\n",
    "* In a **one-way ANOVA**, we will compare multiple sample means\n",
    "* In a **two-way ANOVA**, we will compare sample means that are affected by more than one experimental factor\n",
    "* In a **randomized block ANOVA**, which we will just touch on briefly, we will look at how random factors can be analyzed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1** ANOVAs can get very complicated very quickly! ANOVAs are calculated differently when sample sizes between groups are different or the same, or when the factors included in an ANOVA are fixed (meaningful beyond the bounds of the experiment being considered, such as level of fertilizer applied, or sex of the study organism) or random (meaning factors that might be expected to vary in unpredictable ways, such as different cages in which lab mice are housed, or fields in which plants are grown). Understanding these differences is very important and planning an experiment that requires ANOVA should be done in consultation with a statistician or an experienced practitioner. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2** Many of the resources you will find online about using ANOVA will assume that you are using R statistical software. Running an ANOVA in R will have a different syntax than in python, but the fundamentals are very similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Comparing multiple means with one-way ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest application of ANOVA is to compare three or more means to one another. If a two-sample t-test asks 'Does sample A differ from sample B?' a one way ANOVA asks 'Do samples A, B, C, ... differ from one another?'\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load up a dataset. In the `data` folder is a file called `test_aves.csv`. In the code window below, load that dataset up and print out the header to make sure you have it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set consists of a series of students from four universities, Male and Female, and their average exam scores in three areas: calculus, chemistry, and biology."
