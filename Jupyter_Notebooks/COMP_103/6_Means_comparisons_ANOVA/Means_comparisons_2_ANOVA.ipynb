    "# Comparing means with ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "The next means comparison strategy we will investigate is the ANOVA, or ANalysis Of VAriance. This is a means comparison strategy that is often used in the life sciences. The name can be a bit confusing, as this test detects differences among means by calculating the ratios between different variance components - specifically the ratio of the variance between samples (which corresponds to the variance among species, experimental treatments, localities, or whatever else we may be comparing) to the variance within samples (the error or residual variance, variability in the data that cannot be attributed to our experimental factors).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to how the the t-test assigned statistical significance by calculating a t-statistic that is then compared to a table of t-values, the ANOVA assigns statistical significance by calculating an **F-statistic** that is compared to a table of F-values. Most simply this can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "F = <u>between sample variance</u>   \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within sample variance\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will compare three different types of ANOVA:\n",
    "* In a **one-way ANOVA**, we will compare multiple sample means\n",
    "* In a **two-way ANOVA**, we will compare sample means that are affected by more than one experimental factor\n",
    "* In a **randomized block ANOVA**, which we will just touch on briefly, we will look at how random factors can be analyzed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1** ANOVAs can get very complicated very quickly! ANOVAs are calculated differently when sample sizes between groups are different or the same, or when the factors included in an ANOVA are fixed (meaningful beyond the bounds of the experiment being considered, such as level of fertilizer applied, or sex of the study organism) or random (meaning factors that might be expected to vary in unpredictable ways, such as different cages in which lab mice are housed, or fields in which plants are grown). Understanding these differences is very important and planning an experiment that requires ANOVA should be done in consultation with a statistician or an experienced practitioner. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2** Many of the resources you will find online about using ANOVA will assume that you are using R statistical software. Running an ANOVA in R will have a different syntax than in python, but the fundamentals are very similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Comparing multiple means with one-way ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest application of ANOVA is to compare three or more means to one another. If a two-sample t-test asks 'Does sample A differ from sample B?' a one way ANOVA asks 'Do samples A, B, C, ... differ from one another?'\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load up a dataset. In the `data` folder is a file called `test_aves.csv`. In the code window below, load that dataset up and print out the header to make sure you have it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set consists of a 1000 average exam scores in three areas: calculus, chemistry, and biology."

    "Hopefully you see the data in front of you. (If you have peeked at the data you might see that we are ignoring some columns ... we will come back to them with the more complex ANOVAs below right now we are going to pretend that those columns don't exist.) \n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, before we start comparing means, let's explore the data. ANOVA has three major assumptions, which are fundamentally the same as the assumptions of regression 1) that the data points are independent of one another 2) that the samples are drawn from a normal distribution, and 3) that the groups being compared have similar variances. Assume that the scores are a random collection of scores from each university, such that each data series in the dataframe is independent, or in other words that the rows don't mean anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 1) is really a question of experimental design. To start, we will assume that each of these observations is simply a list of the 1000 most recent test averages in each of these disciplines, such that the rows do not represent individual students. That would make things a little trickier, as each student's scores would violate the assumption of independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 2) the noramlity assumption, is trickier and often misstated (try googling it, you will see). An immediate thought might be that we can test this by checking to see if the data is distributed normally, but let's think about that for a second. What if the average test score in each subject was in fact very different? We might expect to see three different curves centered around the average scores for each subject. This would not be a normal distribution of the data! The actual assumption of normality is that the residuals are normally distributed. In the case of a one-way ANOVA, that means the differences between the observed data in each group and the mean of each group should themselves be normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 3) is relatively straightforward. Each group must have similar variances. This compares to the regression assumption that variance in y stays constant as the value of x increases, but this is now translated into a situation in which we compare different groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code window below, take a pass at using the tools we have learned so far to demonstrate that each of these three conditions is met. You can use visualizations or other statistical tests to do so. You may want to compare the variance directly, plot the data with a histogram, or use the Q-Q plot introduced in the t-test section. \n"
