    "In order to do hypothesis testing with statistics we need to understand how to calculate the probability of obtaining a particular sample from an underlying distribution. Without this step, we can't compare sample parameters to one another or to a fixed value. To do this, we need to understand the concept of the **probability mass function** for discrete distributions or the **probability density function** for continuous distributions. \n",

    "Let's start with a very simple example. Consider a coin that you toss two times. There are only three possible outcomes in terms of how many times you will throw 'heads': 0, 1, or 2. Intuitively we understand that 1/4 of the time we should throw only tails, 1/2 of the time we should throw 1 head and 1 tail, and 1/4 of the time we should throw heads twice. If we organize this information into a **frequency distribution table** it would look like this:\n",
